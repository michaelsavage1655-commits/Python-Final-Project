# Python-Final-Project
My final projet in python

Steps I took:
1.
I found a dataset on Kaggle about TAS (tool assisted) speedruns that I found intersting.
Here's the link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cmmm976/video-game-speedrun-and-tas-world-record-times
Here are some questions I had about the dataset:
 How do the different varables correlate?
 What's the standard deviation for time and other variables?

2.
I made sure there wre no missing vaues, outliers, duplicates or incorrect datatypes.

3.
I manipulated the data to allow for easier analytics for certain calculations.

4.
I wrote some code to auto generate every possible scatterplot between numeric variables. (I kinda got carried away with a lot of this.)

5.
I wrote a program that auto-generated descriptive statistics for all of the numeric variables.

6.
I made a correlation matrix for every numerical variable.
Time has a medium spread centered around 1226.0







Released Year has a small spread centered around 1993.0







Age has a small spread centered around 28.0







Number Of Runs has a large spread centered around 7.0


Tas Time has a medium spread centered around 1002.005


Time Difference has a medium spread centered around 163.72000000000003


Percent Of Difference has a medium spread centered around 13.0697674418605
